    description: 'Conda configuration. When the channel alias is Anaconda.org or an Anaconda Server GUI, you can set the system configuration so that users automatically see private packages. Anaconda.org was formerly known as binstar.org. This uses the Anaconda command-line client, which you can install with conda install anaconda-client, to automatically add the token to the channel URLs. The default is "true".

When allow_softlinks is "false", conda still uses hard-links when possible, but when it is not possible, conda copies files. Individual packages can override this option, specifying that certain files should never be soft-linked. The default is "true".

  channel-priority:
    description: 'Conda configuration. Accepts values of "strict", "flexible", and "disabled". The default value is "flexible". With strict channel priority, packages in lower priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority, the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either "true" or "false". "true" is now an alias to "flexible".
